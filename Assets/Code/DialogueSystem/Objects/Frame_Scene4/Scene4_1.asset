      on one side of the seesaw then all jump on the other end. We would try and see
      how high we could launch them.

  - line: We stopped playing because one kid hit his head on the drainage pipe and
      blacked out. He argued that since when he was unconscious he saw heaven that
      he had gone higher then anyone could ever go, so there was no use in playing
      anymore.
