# Intro:
Welcome to the PuttPlot text adventure! The following files were initially written as a way to manage the game's script, but can also be played through (albeit more limitedly) as its own experience. 

*This project was made with Twinery. If you would like to easily view all branching paths without playing the game, download the files and upload them to Twinery.
Otherwise, please just download the files and enjoy!*

In the game, choices are made in VR by using your putt-putt club to sink a ball into one of several holes present on giant skeeball-esque boards. 
The game plays with the concept of diageticism, i.e. what is of the story world and what isn't. It does this by mapping the flumoxy nature of first date conversations onto the uncertain but skill-based outcome of golf. 
When choosing your responses, it is recommended you keep in mind that VR players must balance their desired outcome against their skill. 
Also note the script is written with the fact that in-game only one line of dialogue appears at a time in mind, so pacing and punchlines won't translate as well via text adventure.


# Boards:
We created four board types to provide players with an interesting and diverse blend of choices between intellectual / player-expression based choices and risk vs. reward / skill-based choices. In later iterations, the game will include more diverse hole layouts with unique board hazards linked to the ongoing story. Future iterations will also have objects in the player's 3d space that can affect gameplay or story.  

*Binary Board:* Contains two centerally spaced and equidifficult holes, easy shots with outcome determined by player expression.

*Heart Board:* Four choices, with upper two being sometimes slightly more desirable outcomes, but still heavy focus on player expression.

*Skeeball Board:* Four choices, arranged like a skeeball board so the outcome is largely skill based. By aiming for the top hole, player risks missing and having the ball roll down into the bottom hole.

*Pinball Board:* Four choices, but weird hole placements and board contains bumpers that'll launch the ball around. Represents random or unpredictable moments with partially random outcomes often heightening comedic moments.
